Discord Bot to Query Valorant Data

Make sure to edit the .env file with your personal Discord and Riot Games API token.

You may need to pip install Discord or Valorant's python API if those aren't working for you. Check out this documentation for help on the Discord side: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html and then check out this documentation for Riot Games' Valorant: https://valorantpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/

You also will need to go through Discord's process of creating a viable bot account, but you can at the very least use this source code to help yourself get there.
