Discord Bot to Query Valorant Data

![Discord](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15940140/179073409-d7e60d18-fb57-4d70-bf6d-0e5ba5fb5c08.png)


## Description

Using both the API from Discord and Riot Games, I made a Discord bot that allows you to query the Riot Games database in real-time!

Want to know the current top 100 leaderboard? No problem.

Interested in getting a list of all available item skins in the game? I got you covered.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows
* Python 3.x
* Some familiarity with Discord and Discord server ownership


### Installing

* Create your Riot Games Valorant API key, follow this guide: https://valorantpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/
* Create your Discord API key, follow this guide: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html
* Edit the .env file to add both of the API keys
* Go through the process of creating a Discord bot, linked in the guide above

### Executing program

* Download the .py files as well as the Valorant library
* The bot.py file handles the bot's logic
* The methods.py file handles the user's communication with the bot and information you can retrieve
* Run the methods.py file 

## Help
Make sure to double check both the valorant and discord guides I linked above.

You must edit the .env file with both of your API keys, otherwise the bot will not run.
